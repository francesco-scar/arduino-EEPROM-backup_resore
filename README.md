# Arduino EEPROM backup resore
Simple script to backup entire EEPROM memory and restore it later.

This might be useful when you have some relevant configuration saved in EEPROM (such as some 3d printer configuration) but you want to upload another sketch without losing them.

(I will add more later on)
